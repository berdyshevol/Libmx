# Libmx
A library of useful functions, that we used in other projects.
This is my own implementations of functions:
- to work with __strings__
- to work with __memory__
- to work with __linked list__
- __algorithms__:  
  binary search  
  buble sort  
  quick sort
- miscellaneous:  
  itoa  
  foreach (higher-order function in C)
